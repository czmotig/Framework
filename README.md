# Common
Common (shareable) features, extensions and classes.

The main project is Neptuo, which is designed as System.dll extension. Here are features that can be used in most projects and, which is important, is doesn't reference any library other than System. Other mentionable projects are:

### Neptuo.Bootstrap
Simple library for creating bootstrap classes and arranging application bootstrap.

### Neptuo.PresentationModels
Data model abstractions for presentation layer.

### Neptuo.Commands and Neptuo.Queries
This library provides abstraction over Command and Query segregation.

### Neptuo.Migrations
Simple library for creating and executing migrations.

### Others
Other projects contain some web stuff, some are designed to the [SharpKit](http://www.sharpkit.net) and much more.

We are planning to split this repository and solution...
